# A telephone translator

## What is the usecase for that?

You can use this if you want to write a SMS on an old phone or smth like that.
I know that nobody ever will use this....

But yeah I found it quite interesting

## What does it?

You can handover a string or a number:

### 1. String

The script takes the string and "translates" it to the suitable number.
The numbers show the key which would had to be pressed on the phone years ago.

### 2. Numeric

The script takes the number and translates it into possible characters one by one.
Afterwards it checks which of the possible combinations of the possible chars could be a correct word and prints them out.
